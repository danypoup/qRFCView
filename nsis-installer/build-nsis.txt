NSIS installer
(made from similar doc by Christophe Gisquet)

1) Getting NSIS from http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ and install it
2) Make some folder inside qrfcview folder, like nsis-installer/.
3) Copy qrfcview.nsi to this folder
4) From your build of qRFCView and installation of Qt4, copy those files/folders,
   keeping the paths, to nssis-installer/:

  bin\mingwm10.dll
  bin\QtCore4.dll
  bin\QtDesignerComponents4.dll
  bin\QtGui4.dll
  bin\QtNetwork4.dll
  bin\qRFCView.exe

5) Double-click on the .nsi file and the installer will automatically be built.
